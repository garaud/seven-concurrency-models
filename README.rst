Seven Concurency Models
=======================

My playground & sandbox about the book `Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks
<https://pragprog.com/book/pb7con/seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks>`_ by
Paul Butcher.

Just some piece of code in C++11, Common Lisp, Clojure or Python inspired from
examples of the book.

It's an occasion to manipulate the new multithreading features of C++11.

About C++, I generate Makefile with CMake_ and compile with GCC_ and Clang_.
